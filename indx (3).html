<h>Chocolate brownie cake in a pan from 5 ingredients</h>
<br><img src="https://www.krutit.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/KRT_6772-764x512.jpg"/><br/>
<p><div>In fact, this is a recipe that is prepared in the pan and baked in it.</div>
<br> Whether you bake this extra chocolate brownie cake on the gas or in the oven,<br/>
 all the preparation steps including baking are done in one pan. And you know what that means right? Tool saving!</p>
<br>And not a word that all it takes to make this miraculous happiness is just 5 ingredients<br/>
<p><br>Just pay attention:<br/>
<br>- In order to bake the brownies in a pan on the gas, it is important to have a quality pan, with a thick bottom and a non-stick.
 I used a kind of quality enamel pan but after a million attempts better a quality pan. One that has a lid.<br/>
 <br>- If you want to bake in the oven, where by the way success is more guaranteed because the heat distribution is more uniform 
 (the preparation by the way will still be all in the pan on the gas), <br>you will need a pan that can fit in the oven and has no plastic handles.<br/>
 <br>- And you can also prepare everything in a simple regular pan (or in a pot) that everyone has, and the prepared batter is transferred to a 20 cm diameter mold, preferably a ceramic mold that is served in it but not critical, then bake in the oven exactly as written below in steps.<br>
 <br>-Another option is to transfer the prepared batter, after its preparation in a pan or pot, to mini molds such as those in which a souffle is made and fill to 1/2 height and no more. You got brownie desserts with boiling chocolate lava inside that are a dream.<br/>

<h3>Chocolate brownies cake in a pan</h3>

-For the gluten-free version read the comments below
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul>
<li>100 grams of butter</li>
<li>150 grams of dark chocolate (+ 50 grams of chopped extra)</li>
<li>Half a cup of light brown suga</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>3 heaping tablespoons puffed spelled flour</li>

</ul>
<h4>For serving:</h4>
<ul>
<li>80 grams of dark chocolate</li>
<li>38% sweet cream half container</li>
<li>vanilla ice cream</li>
</ul>
<h4><style= "size 14"></style=>Preparation:</h4>
<p>- In a high-quality non-stick pan and with a relatively thick bottom (diameter 20 or 22),<br> preferably one that can be placed in the oven, melt the butter and chocolate (150 g) over low heat and make sure to mix so that the chocolate does not burn.</p>
<p>- When a glossy chocolate sauce is formed, turn off the heat and add sugar.<br> Prey for half a minute just until the sugar is gone. Note that at this point the fire is extinguished.</p>
<p>- Beat the eggs in a small bowl and add to the pan. Prey well until completely absorbed in the batter.</p>
<p>- Add flour and mix until the flour is absorbed.</p>
<p>- Add the rest of the chocolate (note that the chocolate will be coarsely chopped and possibly chocolate chips) and mix.<br> The fire at this point is still off.</p>
<p>And now 2 options: If your pan is thick and high quality, and of course non-stick, you can cover with a lid that closes tightly and bake on the gas, on low heat,<br> for 10-15 minutes depending on the heat conduction of the pan.</p>
<br>It is recommended to open after 10 minutes and see that the edges are stable and the middle is a bit vibrating. Another option, and a little safer
<br>is to transfer the pan to a preheated oven at 180 degrees and bake for 15-20 minutes. Either way,<br> itâ€™s important to keep the brownies from drying out and make sure the middle stays vibrating and soft
