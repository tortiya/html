<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon mixed spice</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
<li>1½ cups butter</li>
<li>1¾ cups superfine sugar</li>
<li>6 eggs</li>
<li>2 cups raisins</li>
<li>2 cups golden raisins</li>
<li>4 cups dried currants</li>
<li>1 cup candied cherries</li>
<li>¾ cup chopped almonds</li>
<li>2 tablespoons brandy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grease an 8 inch square baking dish and line it with parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, mixed spice, cinnamon and lemon zest. Stir with a whisk until blended. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing until each one is blended in. Stir in the dry ingredients just until moistened, then fold in the raisins, golden raisins, currants, cherries and almonds</li>
<li>Spoon into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Make a slight impression in the center with the back of a spoon so the cake will turn out level. Cover and leave in a cool place overnight.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the cake pan on a baking sheet.</li>
<li>Bake for 4 hours in the preheated oven. When the cake is done, a skewer inserted into the center should come out clean. Cool in the pan for 1 hour, then turn out onto a wire rack and remove the paper. When completely cool, poke with a skewer every inch or so, and spoon brandy into the holes. Wrap in waxed paper and store in a cool place until serving</li>
</ul>
